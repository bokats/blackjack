## Smart Blackjack

### Background

Blackjack is the most popular casino banking game in the world. It is
played between the dealer and a player. A player can
win in one of the following ways:

1) Get 21 points on the first two cards(blackjack)
2) Get more points than dealer without exceeding 21
3) Let dealer deal more cards until his/her hand exceeds 21

Many variations of the game exist. This project will focus on classic Blackjack
with blackjack pays 3:2 and dealer must hit soft 17.

Smart black will not only allow the player to play the game, but will also
give him/her advice on the correct moves based on the probability of success
and expected outcome for each possible move.
